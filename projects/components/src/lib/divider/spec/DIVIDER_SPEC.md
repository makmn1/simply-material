# Divider

## Overview

Dividers visually group related content and sections within layouts.
They should be **visible but not bold.**
Use dividers only when items cannot be grouped effectively with open space.
Dividers are intended to **group related items**, not to separate individual ones.

---

## Structure

* **Divider line:** A thin visible rule that spans part or all of the container width.
* **Spacing:** Optional space may appear between the divider and supporting text or content.

---

## Behavior

Dividers provide visual organization and hierarchy without drawing excessive attention.
They should not be used excessively or to divide single elements.
